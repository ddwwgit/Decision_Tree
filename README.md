# Decision_Tree

## Overview
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook that guides you through the process of implementing a decision tree from scratch. The primary focus of this exercise is on classifying mushrooms as either edible or poisonous based on their characteristics.

## Content
- Introduction to Decision Trees: A brief refresher on the decision tree algorithm and its application in classification tasks.
- Problem Statement: A detailed description of the classification problem we aim to solve using a decision tree.
- Dataset: Introduction to the dataset used in this exercise, including details on how it's structured and how to preprocess it for the decision tree algorithm.

### Implementation Steps:
- Calculate Entropy: Learn how to calculate the entropy of a dataset, which is a measure of the dataset's disorder or uncertainty.
- Split Dataset: Understand how to split the dataset based on attribute values to improve the purity of the subsets.
- Calculate Information Gain: Learn how to calculate the information gain, which helps in deciding which attribute to split on at each step of building the tree.
- Get Best Split: Implement the logic to find the best split for dataset partitioning at each step of the tree-building process.
- Building the Tree: Combine all the previous steps to construct the decision tree from the ground up.

### Prerequisites
Before starting with the notebook, ensure you have the following packages installed:

- numpy: For matrix operations and numerical processing.
- matplotlib: For plotting graphs and visualizing the data.
